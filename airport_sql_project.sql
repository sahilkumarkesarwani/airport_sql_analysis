	Origin_airport,
    Destination_airport,
    SUM(Passengers) * 1.0/ NULLIF(SUM(seats), 0)  AS Passenger_to_Seats_Ratio

## Problem Statement 8 : 

-- The aim is to determine the top 10 origin airports with the highest frequency of flights. 

SELECT
	Origin_airport,
    SUM(Flights) AS flight_frequency
FROM airports
GROUP BY Origin_airport
ORDER BY flight_frequency DESC
LIMIT 10;


-- This analysis will highlight the most active airports in terms of flight operations, 
-- providing valuable insights for airlines and stakeholders to optimize scheduling and improve service offerings at these critical locations.


## Problem Statement 9 :

-- The objective is to identify the cities (excluding Bend, OR) that sends the most flights and passengers to Bend, OR. 

SELECT
	origin_city,
    SUM(Flights) AS total_flights,
    SUM(Passengers) AS total_passengers
FROM airports
WHERE Destination_city = "Bend, OR"
	AND Origin_city <> "Bend, OR"
GROUP BY origin_city
ORDER BY total_flights DESC, total_passengers DESC;


-- This analysis will reveal key contributors to passenger traffic at Bend, OR, 
-- helping airlines and travel authorities understand demand patterns and enhance connectivity from popular originating cities.

## Problem Statement 10 : 

-- The aim is to identify the longest flight route in terms of distance traveled, including both the origin and destination airports. 

SELECT 
	Origin_airport,
    Destination_airport,
    MAX(Distance) AS max_distance
